## Overview
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game repository! This project is the culmination of my advanced programming course at Tehran University, where I ventured into the exciting world of game development using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

## Key Features
1. Classic Tic-Tac-Toe Gameplay
Experience the timeless joy of playing Tic-Tac-Toe with your friends in a digital format. The game retains the classic rules, where two players take turns marking 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid to win the match.

2. SFML-Powered Graphics
The game's graphical interface is powered by the SFML library, which offers smooth and interactive graphics. SFML simplifies the process of rendering graphics, handling user input, and managing audio, making it an excellent choice for game development in C++.

3. User-Friendly Interface
The intuitive user interface ensures that players can effortlessly enjoy the game. The grid updates in real-time, and the game announces the winner or a draw once the match concludes.

## Getting Started
